# ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA for Time Series Forecasting
This project demonstrates the use of ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages) and Seasonal ARIMA models for forecasting time series data. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach to build these models using a dataset of monthly Champagne sales.

# Project Structure
Data Import: The project begins by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration: The time series data is visualized to understand its characteristics.
Stationarity Check: Techniques are applied to ensure the data is stationary, a key requirement for ARIMA models.
Correlation Analysis: Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots are used to determine appropriate parameters for the ARIMA model.
Model Building: The ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA models are constructed based on the data characteristics.
Forecasting: The models are used to predict future values in the time series.
# Requirements
To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
statsmodels
You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels
# Usage
Load the Data: Replace the dataset path with your time series data.
Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to replicate the analysis and model building.
Make Predictions: Use the final model to make forecasts on your data.

# Conclusion
This project serves as a practical guide to implementing ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA models for time series forecasting. It covers the end-to-end process from data preparation to model deployment.
